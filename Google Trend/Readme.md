## Key Takeaways

- Use `.describe()` to quickly get an overview of descriptive statistics for numerical data in a DataFrame.
  
- Use `.resample()` to adjust the periodicity of time-series data, allowing for comparison across different time intervals (e.g., daily to monthly).

- Utilize `matplotlib.dates Locators` to effectively style the timeline of a chart, ensuring clear and readable date axis formatting.

- Determine the number of NaN values in a DataFrame column using `.isna().values.sum()`.

- Adjust the resolution of a Matplotlib chart by setting the figure's DPI (dots per inch) with `plt.figure(figsize=(width, height), dpi=desired_dpi)`.

- Create dashed (`'--'`) and dotted (`'-.'`) lines in Matplotlib charts using the `linestyle` parameter.

- Customize data points in plots by specifying different markers (`'o'`, `'s'`, `'^'`, etc.) to represent data series distinctively.

- Fine-tune Matplotlib chart styling with precise control over axis limits, labels, line widths, and colors (using named colors or HEX codes).

- Enhance visual clarity in time-series analysis by using `.grid(True)` to add gridlines, aiding in identifying seasonality and trends.
