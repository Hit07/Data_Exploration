## Overview
In this project, we explored the popularity trends of various programming languages over time using Python's pandas and matplotlib libraries. Here's what we learned and accomplished:

## Key Takeaways and Learnings

### 1. Grouping and Aggregating Data
- **`groupby()`**: We used `groupby()` to aggregate data by programming language, allowing us to analyze the number of posts and entries per language.

### 2. Data Manipulation
- **Converting Dates**: Using `pd.to_datetime()`, we converted date strings to datetime objects for easier handling and plotting.

### 3. Reshaping Data
- **`pivot()`**: We reshaped our DataFrame by converting categorical data into columns using `pivot()`, which was useful for structured data analysis.

### 4. Handling Missing Data
- **`isna().values.any()` and `fillna()`**: We checked for NaN values in our DataFrame and filled them using `fillna()` to ensure data integrity.

### 5. Data Visualization
- **Creating Line Charts**: Using `.plot()` and iterating with a for-loop, we created multiple line charts to visualize trends over time.

### 6. Chart Styling
- **Customizing Plots**: We customized our charts by adjusting sizes, labels, and axis bounds to improve clarity and presentation.

### 7. Analyzing Trends
- **Smoothing Data**: We used `.rolling().mean()` to smooth out time-series data and plotted it to identify long-term trends.
