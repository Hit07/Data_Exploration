# Computation Using NumPy and N-Dimensional Arrays

This repository demonstrates practical usage of NumPy for efficient computation with n-dimensional arrays in Python.

## Key Takeaways

### 1. Arrays with `np.array()`

- Use `np.array()` to create NumPy arrays from Python lists or tuples.

### 2. Generating Arrays

- **`np.arange()`**: Create arrays with evenly spaced values.
- **`np.random()`**: Generate arrays with random values.
- **`np.linspace()`**: Generate arrays with evenly spaced values over a specified interval.

### 3. Analyzing Array Shape and Dimensions

- Use `.shape` and `.ndim` to analyze the shape and dimensions of NumPy arrays.

### 4. Slicing and Subsetting Arrays

- Use indexing and slicing (`array[start:end]`) to subset and manipulate arrays efficiently.

### 5. Linear Algebra Operations

- Perform matrix operations like multiplication (`@` operator) and scalar operations efficiently.

### 6. Broadcasting in NumPy

- NumPy's broadcasting allows arrays with different shapes to be used together in operations.

### 7. Manipulating Images as ndarrays

- Use NumPy arrays to read, manipulate, and process image data efficiently.
